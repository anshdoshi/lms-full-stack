# Video CRUD Operations Guide - LMS Platform

**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FULLY FUNCTIONAL

---

## üìπ How Video CRUD Works

Videos in the LMS are managed as part of the **course content structure**, not as separate entities. This means video CRUD operations are performed through course operations.

---

## ‚úÖ VIDEO CREATE (Add Videos)

### Method 1: Add Videos When Creating a Course
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/educator/add-course`

**Process:**
1. Educator creates a new course
2. Includes video information in course content
3. Can add multiple videos across different chapters

**Video Types Supported:**
- **YouTube Videos:** Provide YouTube URL
- **Uploaded Videos:** Upload video file (stored in Cloudinary)

**Example Course Structure with Videos:**
```json
{
  "courseTitle": "Web Development Course",
  "courseDescription": "<p>Learn web development</p>",
  "coursePrice": 99.99,
  "discount": 20,
  "courseContent": [
    {
      "chapterId": "ch1",
      "chapterOrder": 1,
      "chapterTitle": "Introduction",
      "chapterContent": [
        {
          "lectureId": "lec1",
          "lectureTitle": "Welcome Video",
          "lectureDuration": 15,
          "lectureUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE",
          "isPreviewFree": true,
          "lectureOrder": 1,
          "videoType": "youtube"
        },
        {
          "lectureId": "lec2",
          "lectureTitle": "Setup Guide",
          "lectureDuration": 20,
          "lectureUrl": "",
          "isPreviewFree": false,
          "lectureOrder": 2,
          "videoType": "upload"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**For Uploaded Videos:**
- Field name format: `video_{chapterId}_{lectureId}`
- Example: `video_ch1_lec2`
- Uploaded to Cloudinary `lms-videos` folder
- Optimized to 720p (1280x720)
- Returns secure URL

---

## ‚úÖ VIDEO READ (View Videos)

### Get Course with Videos
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/educator/courses/:id`

**Returns:**
- All course details including videos
- Video URLs for all lectures
- Both YouTube and uploaded video URLs

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "course": {
    "courseContent": [
      {

        "chapterTitle": "Introduction",
        "chapterContent": [
          {
            "lectureId": "lec1",

            "lectureTitle": "Advanced Topics",
            "lectureUrl": "https://res.cloudinary.com/.../video.mp4",
            "lectureDuration": 25
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## ‚úÖ VIDEO UPDATE (Modify Videos)

### Method: Update Course Content
**Endpoint:** `PUT /api/educator/courses/:id`

**What You Can Do:**
1. **Add new videos** to existing chapters
2. **Replace existing videos** with new ones
3. **Change video URLs** (YouTube links)
4. **Upload new video files** to replace old ones
5. **Modify video metadata** (title, duration, preview status)

**Process:**
1. Get current course data
2. Modify the courseContent array
3. Add/update/remove lectures with videos
4. Submit updated course data

**Example: Adding a New Video to Existing Course**
```json
{
  "courseData": {
    "courseTitle": "Web Development Course",
    "courseContent": [
      {
        "chapterId": "ch1",
        "chapterContent": [
          // Existing videos remain
          {
            "lectureId": "lec1",
            "lectureTitle": "Existing Video",
            "lectureUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=existing"
          },
          // New video added
          {
            "lectureId": "lec3",
            "lectureTitle": "New Video",
            "lectureUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=new",
            "lectureDuration": 30,
            "isPreviewFree": false,
            "lectureOrder": 3
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**For Uploading New Videos:**
- Include video file with field name: `video_{chapterId}_{lectureId}`
- Old video URL will be replaced with new Cloudinary URL
- Original video remains in Cloudinary (manual cleanup needed if desired)

---

## ‚úÖ VIDEO DELETE (Remove Videos)

### Method 1: Remove Video from Course Content
**Endpoint:** `PUT /api/educator/courses/:id`

**Process:**
1. Get current course data
2. Remove the lecture object containing the video
3. Update the course

**Example: Removing a Video**
```json
// Before (3 videos)
{
  "chapterContent": [
    {"lectureId": "lec1", "lectureUrl": "video1.mp4"},
    {"lectureId": "lec2", "lectureUrl": "video2.mp4"},
    {"lectureId": "lec3", "lectureUrl": "video3.mp4"}
  ]
}

// After (2 videos - lec2 removed)
{
  "chapterContent": [
    {"lectureId": "lec1", "lectureUrl": "video1.mp4"},
    {"lectureId": "lec3", "lectureUrl": "video3.mp4"}
  ]
}
```

### Method 2: Delete Entire Course (Deletes All Videos)
**Endpoint:** `DELETE /api/educator/courses/:id`

**Process:**
- Deletes the entire course
- All video references removed from database
- Cloudinary files remain (manual cleanup needed)
- **Protection:** Cannot delete if students are enrolled

## üéì Conclusion

**Video CRUD is FULLY FUNCTIONAL** through the course management system:

- ‚úÖ **Create:** Add videos when creating courses
- ‚úÖ **Read:** View all videos in course details
- ‚úÖ **Update:** Modify course content to add/change videos
- ‚úÖ **Delete:** Remove videos by updating course or deleting course

Videos are managed as part of the course content structure, which is the standard approach for LMS platforms. This ensures data integrity and maintains the relationship between courses and their video content.

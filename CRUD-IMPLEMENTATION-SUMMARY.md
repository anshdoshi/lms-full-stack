## ðŸŽ¥ VIDEO FUNCTIONALITY

### Supported Video Types

#### 1. YouTube Videos
- **Format:** YouTube URL
- **Storage:** URL stored in database
- **Example:** `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE`
- **Usage:** Free preview lectures, external content

- **Format:** Video file upload
- **Storage:** Cloudinary
- **Processing:** 
  - Uploaded to `lms-videos` folder
  - Optimized to 720p (1280x720)
  - Chunked upload (6MB chunks)
  - Async processing
- **Usage:** Premium course content

### Video Upload Implementation

**In Course Creation (`addCourse`):**
```javascript
// Video field naming convention
const videoFieldName = `video_${chapter.chapterId}_${lecture.lectureId}`

// Upload to Cloudinary
const videoUpload = await cloudinary.uploader.upload(videoFile.path, {
    resource_type: 'video',
    folder: 'lms-videos',
    chunk_size: 6000000,
    eager: [
        { width: 1280, height: 720, crop: 'limit', format: 'mp4' }
    ],
    eager_async: true
})

// Store URL
lecture.lectureUrl = videoUpload.secure_url
```

**In Course Update (`updateCourse`):**
- Same process as creation
- Only updates videos that are provided
- Maintains existing videos if not replaced

### Video Data Structure

```javascript
{
  "lectureId": "lec1",
  "lectureTitle": "Introduction",
  "lectureDuration": 15,
  "lectureUrl": "https://res.cloudinary.com/.../video.mp4",
  "isPreviewFree": true,
  "lectureOrder": 1,
  "videoType": "upload" // or "youtube"
